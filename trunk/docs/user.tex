To create a complete VM, the various components need to interact and to do so correctly.

So this can happen the VM developer is required to implement a number of functions to assist the GVMT. 
The GVMT provides an API for interacting with generated and library components.

Examining the files in the /example subdirectory may help to make things clearer.

\section{User provided code}

The file /include/gvmt/user.h lists all the functions which the developer needs to supply, with the exception of the \verb|gvmt_shape| function which must be compiled natively, not by \gvmtc.

\subsection{Garbage collection\label{sect:user-shape}}
In order for the tooolkit to provide precise garbage collection, the layout of all heap objects must be known. The developer must provide two functions and one integer value to allow GVMT to perform \emph{precise} garbage collection.
\begin{description}
\item [int GVMT\_MAX\_SHAPE\_SIZE] The maximum number of entries required to represent any shape (including terminating zero).
\item [int* gvmt\_shape(GVMT\_Object object, int* buf)] This function returns a vector of integers, representing the shape of the object, as defined in section \ref{sect:shape}. The int array buf can be used to store the shape if required. The buffer, \verb|buf| is guaranteed to include at least GVMT\_MAX\_SHAPE\_SIZE entries.
\item [void user\_finalize\_object(GVMT\_Object o)] This function may be called by the garbage collector for any object that is declared as requiring finalization and is unreachable. Exceptions raised in this function, or any callee, terminate finalisation, but do not propogate. The function is called by the finalizer thread and will be called asynchronously. This function may be called on any or all object declared as finalizable, in any order. 
\end{description}


\subsection{The Marshalling Interface}
In order to support marshalling the user must provide a function \\
\verb|gvmt_write_func get_marshaller_for_object(GVMT_Object object)| to give a write function for each object. The toolkit can create a write function for any object declaration, but it is unable to determine which function should be applied to which object at runtime. 

To assist marshalling to GSC code, the user should also provide the \\
\verb|void gvmt_readable_name(GVMT_Object object, char *buffer)| function to provide meaningful names for objects.
This function should store an ASCII string into the provided buffer. The buffer is guaranteed to be of at least GVMT\_MAX\_OBJECT\_NAME\_LENGTH bytes in length 

\subsection{Debugging}
The GVMT can insert calls to a trace function at the start of each bytecode. Since GVMT knows nothing about the semantics of the VM, the developer must provide the actual trace function. A very simple version is provided in the example.

\section{GVMT provided functions}
GVMT provides a wide range of functions to interact with the underlying abstract machine, as well as a number of intrinsic functions for code written in C.

\subsection{The evaluation stack}
The evaluation stack can be examined and modified in C code, using intinsics:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|gvmt_stack_top()| returns a pointer to the top-of-stack.
\item \verb|gvmt_insert(size_t n)| inserts n NULLs onto the stack and returns a pointer to them.
\item \verb|GVMT_PUSH(x)| can be used to push individual values on to the stack.
\item \verb|gvmt_drop(size_t n)| discards n items from the top of the stack.
\end{itemize}
Care should be taken with these functions as they manipulate the evaluation stack, which is used to evaluate expression. It is best to keep any C statement using these intrinsics as simple as possible.

\subsection{The call stack}
The call stack is generally opaque, except for interpreter frames, which can be accessed using the following intinsics:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|gvmt_current_frame()| returns a opaque pointer to the currently executing interpreter frame.
\item \verb|gvmt_caller_frame(void* frame)| takes a pointer to an interpreter frame and returns a pointer to its caller.
\item \verb|gvmt_frame_index(char* name)| returns an index for a named local. This index can be used to read the local variables of a given frame.
\item \verb|gvmt_frame_item_r(void* frame, unsigned index)| returns the reference local variable corresponding to the given index.
\item \verb|gvmt_frame_item_p(void* frame, unsigned index)| returns the pointer local variable corresponding to the given index.
\item \verb|gvmt_frame_item_i(void* frame, unsigned index)| returns the integer local variable corresponding to the given index.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The garbage collector\label{sect:user-roots}}

The following intrinsic allocates object (the GSC code is GC\_MALLOC).
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|GVMT_Object gvmt_malloc(size_t s)| Allocates a new object. This object should be initialised immediately, and \emph{must} be initialised before the next GC-SAFE point.
\end{itemize}

The garbage collector can automatically find all objects from both stacks and all global variables. Sometimes it is necessary to have some control over the garbage collector.
GVMT provides the following functions to interact with the garbage collector.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|gvmt_gc_finalizable(GVMT_Object obj)| Declares that obj will need finalization.
\item \verb|void* gvmt_gc_weak_reference(void)| Returns a weak reference to obj.
\item \verb|GVMT_Object gvmt_gc_read_weak_reference(void* w)| Reads a weak reference, the reference returned will either be the last value written to this weak-reference or NULL.
\item \verb|gvmt_gc_read_weak_reference(void* w, GVMT_Object o)| Writes to a weak reference
\item \verb|void gvmt_gc_free_weak_reference(void* w)| Frees a weak reference if no longer required.
\item \verb|void* gvmt_gc_add_root(void)| Returns a new root to the heap, initialised to obj.
\item \verb|GVMT_Object gvmt_gc_read_root(void* root)| Returns the value referred to by the root.
\item \verb|void gvmt_gc_write_root(void* root, GVMT_Object obj)| Writes a new object to a root.
\item \verb|void gvmt_gc_free_root(void* root)| Deletes this root, the object referred to may now be garbage collected.

\item \verb|void* gvmt_gc_pin(GVMT_Object obj)| Pins the object referred to by \verb|obj|. The garbage collector will not move it. Be aware that collection and pinning are independent. The grabge collector may collect pinned objects. To pass an object to native code, or to use an internal pointer will require both pinning the object \emph{and} retaining a refeerence to it.
\item \verb|gvmt_gc_unpin(GVMT_Object obj)| Unpins the object, which may now by moved by the garbage collector. It is not necessary to unpin objects in order for them to be garbage collected.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exception handling\label{sect:user-except}}
Three intrinsics are provided:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|GVMT_Object gvmt_protect(void)| Intrinsic for the PROTECT instruction.
\item \verb|void gvmt_unprotect(void)| Intrinsic for the UNPROTECT instruction.
\item \verb|void gvmt_raise(GVMT_Object ex)| Intrinsic for the RAISE instruction.
\end{itemize}

Rather than use \verb|GVMT_Object gvmt_protect()| and \verb|void gvmt_unprotect()| directly developers should use the macros: 
\verb|GVMT_TRY|, \verb|GVMT_CATCH| and \verb|GVMT_END_TRY| as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
GVMT_TRY(exception_variable)
    code which may raise exception
GVMT_CATCH
    code to execute if an exception is raised
GVMT_END_TRY
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Threading\label{sect:user-threads}}
Since the GVMT relies on the operating system to provide threading support, it must be informed when a new thread is created and used.
To start running GVMT code in a new thread, call:
\begin{verbatim}
int gvmt_enter(uintptr_t stack_space, gvmt_func_ptr func, int pcount, ...);
\end{verbatim}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|stack_space| is the amount of items required on the evaluation stack,
\item \verb|gvmt_func_ptr| is the GSC function to execute, and
\item \verb|pcount| is the number of parameters following.
\end{itemize}

If reentering GVMT from native code that was is running in an already initialised thread, then use 
\begin{verbatim}
int gvmt_reenter(gvmt_func_ptr func, int pcount, ...);
\end{verbatim}
to avoid reinitialising the running thread.

When a thread has finished call \verb|gvmt_finished(void)|.

The Glasgow Virtual Machine Toolkit (GVMT) allows easy construction of virtual machines. It handles garbage collection automatically, and builds interpreters and compilers from a common specification. The toolkit helps the rapid development of various sorts of interpreters, such as bytecode instrumentation and transformation passes, making the implementation of a high-performance virtual machine much easier.
